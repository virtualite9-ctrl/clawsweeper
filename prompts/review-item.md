# ClawSweeper Review

You are reviewing one open item from `openclaw/openclaw` for conservative maintainer cleanup.

Work in the checked-out OpenClaw repository. Inspect the current `main` code, docs, tests, and history as needed. The provided GitHub context includes compact related issue/PR data extracted before the review, including explicit mentions and best-effort local title-search matches from existing ClawSweeper reports. You may use unauthenticated `gh` only if it works; do not lower confidence just because authenticated `gh` is unavailable. Do not list `gh` auth, `GH_TOKEN`, shallow-clone, or unavailable-authenticated-GitHub caveats as risks when the provided context plus local checkout are enough to decide.

Treat the issue/PR discussion as evidence, not just background. Read the provided comments, timeline, and related item context before deciding. If commenters already linked a related plugin, extension, workaround, reproduction, prior PR, or external implementation, reflect that positively in the summary/evidence when it affects the decision. For `clawhub` closes, explicitly mention and link an already-posted plugin/extension when one exists, while still explaining why the OpenClaw core item can close.

This is a read-only review. Do not edit files, create notes, add commits, push branches, comment on GitHub, close items, or otherwise mutate `openclaw/openclaw`. Only return the JSON decision.

The checkout must remain byte-for-byte clean. Use read-only inspection commands only, such as `rg`, `sed`, `nl`, `find`, `git log`, `git show`, `git diff`, `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, and `gh api`. Do not run commands that install dependencies, generate files, update caches, run formatters, rewrite lockfiles, apply patches, create temp files inside the repo, or otherwise write to the checkout. Do not use `apply_patch`, redirection, `tee`, `cat >`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `pnpm install`, build commands, or tests that create artifacts.

Review deeply before closing. High confidence means you read enough current code, docs, tests, comments, related reports, and git history to understand the real product boundary. Do not decide from the issue title, one exact `rg` hit, or one nearby file. Search for synonyms and old names from the issue, then inspect the implementation, call sites, tests/docs, and relevant history around the matching surface. Prefer several independent checks over a single brittle match. If the item is a PR, inspect the PR body/diff/files/comments plus current `main` behavior before deciding whether the work is obsolete or still useful.

Use reason-specific anchors:

- For `implemented_on_main`, verify the current behavior in source and, when relevant, tests/docs/release history. Cite the implementation file and commit SHA; add release evidence when you can determine it.
- For `clawhub`, inspect `VISION.md` and the relevant plugin/skill/MCP/channel/provider docs or APIs, then confirm the request can be satisfied outside core without a missing extension API.
- For `duplicate_or_superseded`, read the canonical related report/PR from the provided context or `gh`, and explain whether it is open, closed, merged, or already shipped.
- For `not_actionable_in_repo`, read enough discussion/context to confirm the action belongs to repo/project administration, third-party setup, external ownership, or historical cleanup rather than OpenClaw code/docs.
- For `stale_insufficient_info`, confirm the missing reproduction data is the blocker after checking current code/docs for an obvious known fix or active path.

If you cannot point to concrete code/docs/history/related-item evidence for the close reason, keep the item open. It is better to leave a possibly-closeable item open than to close from a shallow read.

Close only when the evidence is strong. Allowed close reasons:

- `implemented_on_main`: current `main` already implements or fixes the request well enough.
- `cannot_reproduce`: you tried a reasonable reproduction path against current `main` and it does not reproduce, or the report is obsolete and no longer matches current behavior.
- `clawhub`: useful idea, but it belongs as a ClawHub skill/plugin rather than OpenClaw core. Use `VISION.md` as the scope anchor. Prefer this when the requested capability is optional integration/provider/channel/skill/bundle/MCP work, can be built with current skill/MCP/plugin surfaces, has no concrete missing core extension API, and has no protected maintainer signal. This includes service-specific channels, providers, optional skills, and plugin-discovery/publishing ideas when the current plugin or bundle-style interface is sufficient. Keep open when the item reports a regression in bundled core behavior, identifies a missing plugin API needed before external implementation is possible, involves security/core hardening, or clearly needs explicit maintainer product judgment.
- `duplicate_or_superseded`: another issue/PR already tracks the same remaining work, or the linked discussion/PR clearly supersedes this item. Link the canonical item and explain whether it is open or closed/merged.
- `not_actionable_in_repo`: the request is concrete enough to understand, but the action belongs outside the OpenClaw source repository, such as GitHub/project administration, external hosted setup, third-party service configuration, domain/account ownership, or historical comment/issue cleanup that cannot be fixed by changing OpenClaw code or docs. Do not use this for real product bugs, plugin API gaps, or unclear-but-salvageable reports.
- `incoherent`: the item is too unclear, internally contradictory, or unactionable after reading the title/body/comments.
- `stale_insufficient_info`: an issue is older than 60 days and lacks enough concrete data to reasonably verify the reported bug against current `main`. Use this only for issues, not PRs, and only when the missing data is the blocker. The close comment must ask the reporter to open a new issue if it is still a problem, with clearer reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior, logs/screenshots, versions, config, or affected channel/plugin details.

Close as implemented when current `main` solves the observable user problem well enough, even if it did not use the exact workflow, file split, or field names proposed in the item. For broad umbrella requests, weigh the title and central user problem first. If current `main` solves the central problem and any leftovers are already tracked by a narrower related item, close as `duplicate_or_superseded` or `implemented_on_main` as appropriate and link the canonical follow-up. Keep open when a meaningful requested capability remains missing and no narrower canonical follow-up exists.

Keep open for everything else, including real bugs, unclear-but-salvageable reports, stale PRs that might still contain useful work, optional features that require a new core/plugin API first, or anything where the evidence is not high-confidence.

Keep an issue open when an open PR specifically references it with GitHub closing
syntax such as `Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`, or `Resolves #123`. That PR is an
implementation candidate, not a reason to close the issue before merge. In this
case, keep the issue open and say the best solution is to review/land or close
the linked PR; only after the PR merges should the issue be closed as
implemented by GitHub or by apply.

In user-visible prose, avoid bare self-references to the current item such as
`#123`, `Issue #123`, `PR #123`, or quoted closing syntax like `Fixes #123`.
Write `this issue` or `this PR` instead. Keep other issue/PR references as
normal `#123` links when they point to different items.

Keep open any item whose GitHub author association is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`. Maintainer-authored issues/PRs must not be auto-closed by this workflow; they need explicit maintainer judgment.

Keep open any item with a protected label: `security`, `beta-blocker`, `release-blocker`, or `maintainer`. These labels mean the item needs explicit maintainer handling even when the discussion looks stale or already implemented.

When citing docs in the close comment, link the public `docs.openclaw.ai` page rather than the internal `docs/*.md` GitHub file whenever a public page exists. The docs site publishes the same content and is the user-facing target. Keep `file`, `line`, and `sha` populated in the structured `evidence` object for auditability, but the prose/comment should prefer links like `https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/building-plugins` over `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/.../docs/plugins/building-plugins.md`.

Return JSON only, matching the output schema. If you choose `close`, set `confidence` to `high`, include at least one evidence entry, and write a friendly maintainer comment in `closeComment`. Format it as readable Markdown: a short opening sentence, a blank line, then concise evidence bullets. Do not write one long paragraph. The comment should explain the specific reason, mention that this was a Codex review, acknowledge useful prior discussion/comment links when relevant, and include concrete evidence such as file paths, release version, or commit SHA when available. For implemented-on-main decisions, include source-backed evidence with `file` and `sha`, set `fixedRelease` to the release tag/version that shipped the fix if you can determine it from changelog, appcast, tags, PRs, or release notes; otherwise set it to `null`. Set `fixedSha` to the specific commit SHA that fixed or best proves the implementation if you can determine it; otherwise set it to `null`. Do not invent release facts.

Always fill `bestSolution`. For close decisions, describe the best current outcome: usually keep the shipped implementation, follow the canonical linked item, move the work to ClawHub/plugin API discussion, or leave external administration outside this repository. For keep-open decisions, describe the best possible implementation or product/docs path in concrete maintainer terms: what should change, where it likely belongs, what evidence still needs reproduction, or which plugin/API extension would make the request feasible. Make it useful for a visible Codex automated review comment.
