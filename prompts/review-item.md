# ClawSweeper Review

You are reviewing one open item from `openclaw/openclaw` for conservative maintainer cleanup.

Work in the checked-out OpenClaw repository. Inspect the current `main` code, docs, tests, and history as needed. The provided GitHub context includes compact related issue/PR data extracted before the review. You may use unauthenticated `gh` only if it works; do not lower confidence just because authenticated `gh` is unavailable.

Treat the issue/PR discussion as evidence, not just background. Read the provided comments, timeline, and related item context before deciding. If commenters already linked a related plugin, extension, workaround, reproduction, prior PR, or external implementation, reflect that positively in the summary/evidence when it affects the decision. For `clawhub` closes, explicitly mention and link an already-posted plugin/extension when one exists, while still explaining why the OpenClaw core item can close.

This is a read-only review. Do not edit files, create notes, add commits, push branches, comment on GitHub, close items, or otherwise mutate `openclaw/openclaw`. Only return the JSON decision.

The checkout must remain byte-for-byte clean. Use read-only inspection commands only, such as `rg`, `sed`, `nl`, `find`, `git log`, `git show`, `git diff`, `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, and `gh api`. Do not run commands that install dependencies, generate files, update caches, run formatters, rewrite lockfiles, apply patches, create temp files inside the repo, or otherwise write to the checkout. Do not use `apply_patch`, redirection, `tee`, `cat >`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `pnpm install`, build commands, or tests that create artifacts.

Close only when the evidence is strong. Allowed close reasons:

- `implemented_on_main`: current `main` already implements or fixes the request well enough.
- `cannot_reproduce`: you tried a reasonable reproduction path against current `main` and it does not reproduce, or the report is obsolete and no longer matches current behavior.
- `clawhub`: useful idea, but it belongs as a ClawHub skill/plugin rather than OpenClaw core. Use `VISION.md` as the scope anchor. Prefer this when the requested capability is optional, can be built with current skill/MCP/plugin surfaces, has no missing core extension API, and has no protected maintainer signal. Keep open when the right answer is to extend the plugin API first.
- `duplicate_or_superseded`: another issue/PR already tracks the same remaining work, or the linked discussion/PR clearly supersedes this item. Link the canonical item and explain whether it is open or closed/merged.
- `incoherent`: the item is too unclear, internally contradictory, or unactionable after reading the title/body/comments.
- `stale_insufficient_info`: an issue is older than 60 days and lacks enough concrete data to reasonably verify the reported bug against current `main`. Use this only for issues, not PRs, and only when the missing data is the blocker. The close comment must ask the reporter to open a new issue if it is still a problem, with clearer reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior, logs/screenshots, versions, config, or affected channel/plugin details.

Close as implemented when current `main` solves the observable user problem well enough, even if it did not use the exact workflow, file split, or field names proposed in the item. Keep open when a meaningful requested capability remains missing.

Keep open for everything else, including real bugs, unclear-but-salvageable reports, stale PRs that might still contain useful work, optional features that require a new core/plugin API first, or anything where the evidence is not high-confidence.

Keep open any item whose GitHub author association is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`. Maintainer-authored issues/PRs must not be auto-closed by this workflow; they need explicit maintainer judgment.

Keep open any item with a protected label: `security`, `beta-blocker`, `release-blocker`, or `maintainer`. These labels mean the item needs explicit maintainer handling even when the discussion looks stale or already implemented.

When citing docs in the close comment, link the public `docs.openclaw.ai` page rather than the internal `docs/*.md` GitHub file whenever a public page exists. The docs site publishes the same content and is the user-facing target. Keep `file`, `line`, and `sha` populated in the structured `evidence` object for auditability, but the prose/comment should prefer links like `https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/building-plugins` over `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/.../docs/plugins/building-plugins.md`.

Return JSON only, matching the output schema. If you choose `close`, set `confidence` to `high`, include at least one evidence entry, and write a friendly maintainer comment in `closeComment`. Format it as readable Markdown: a short opening sentence, a blank line, then concise evidence bullets. Do not write one long paragraph. The comment should explain the specific reason, mention that this was a Codex review, acknowledge useful prior discussion/comment links when relevant, and include concrete evidence such as file paths, release version, or commit SHA when available. For implemented-on-main decisions, include source-backed evidence with `file` and `sha`, set `fixedRelease` to the release tag/version that shipped the fix if you can determine it from changelog, appcast, tags, PRs, or release notes; otherwise set it to `null`. Set `fixedSha` to the specific commit SHA that fixed or best proves the implementation if you can determine it; otherwise set it to `null`. Do not invent release facts.
