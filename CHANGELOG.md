# Changelog

All notable ClawSweeper changes are tracked here.

This file was reconstructed from first-parent git history. Generated dashboard,
checkpoint, and status-only commits are intentionally omitted.

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- Scaffolded ClawSweeper as a conservative OpenClaw maintainer bot that writes one
  markdown review record per open issue or pull request.
- Added proposal-only review flow plus an explicit apply mode for unchanged,
  high-confidence close proposals.
- Added targeted single-item review support.
- Added README dashboard links to generated item reports, fixed evidence, issue
  and PR close-rate metrics, cadence coverage, workflow status, and apply status.
- Added archived `closed/` records so `items/` can stay focused on open tracked
  items.
- Added a read-only audit command for checking live GitHub state against
  generated `items/` and `closed/` records. Thanks @stainlu.
- Added review runtime metadata to detail reports, including model and reasoning
  effort.
- Added MIT licensing.
- Added durable Codex automated review comments that are updated in place before
  any close action.
- Added a separate hourly apply/comment-sync workflow lane that can run
  alongside review work.
- Added a five-minute hot-intake review lane for new and recently active issues
  or pull requests, fanning out single-item review shards.
- Added targeted comment-sync mode so hot-intake reviews can publish durable
  Codex review comments immediately without closing items.
- Separated targeted comment-sync workflow concurrency from bulk apply so hot
  comment runs are not displaced by apply continuation backlog.
- Switched comment and close mutations to the `openclaw-ci` GitHub App
  installation token so GitHub attributes automated comments to the bot.
- Added Latest Run Activity dashboard counters for recent reviews, close
  decisions, comment syncs, apply skips, and close actions.
- Added a README Audit Health section plus a separate scheduled/manual workflow
  path to refresh it without making normal dashboard heartbeats scan GitHub.
  Thanks @stainlu.
- Added comma-separated targeted review dispatch so Audit Health findings can be
  reviewed together without waiting for normal batch selection. Thanks @stainlu.

### Changed

- Switched review runs to GPT-5.5 with high reasoning.
- Increased sweep throughput over time with larger worker batches, 100 shards,
  chained continuation runs, and 50-review checkpoints.
- Renamed workflow run and job displays so review, apply, comment-sync, and
  audit runs are distinguishable in GitHub Actions.
- Made review cadence activity-aware: active items and items created in the last
  7 days are checked hourly, older PRs and young issues are checked daily, and
  older inactive issues are checked weekly.
- Made policy changes force previously fresh reports back into review planning.
- Improved close evidence and comments with structured review notes, public docs
  links, ClawHub links, source links, fixed-version evidence, and nicer Markdown
  formatting.
- Added best-possible-solution review output so both close and keep-open comments
  explain the recommended path.
- Made review prompts acknowledge prior plugin links and prefer public
  `docs.openclaw.ai` links where appropriate.
- Made apply runs issue-only by default, with no age floor, while still excluding
  maintainer-authored items.
- Made apply runs checkpoint their progress, publish dashboard heartbeats, and
  continue automatically while work remains.
- Made scheduled apply runs process both issues and pull requests by default,
  with manual `apply_kind` narrowing still available.
- Made apply checkpoint publish retries auto-resolve generated item/closed
  rename-delete conflicts from concurrent review publishes.
- Reduced the default apply close delay from 5 seconds to 2 seconds.
- Prioritized matching close proposals ahead of broad comment sync during apply
  runs so close batches do not stall on keep-open comment backfill.
- Classified missing-open audit findings so strict mode reports only actionable
  missing-open drift while preserving total visibility. Thanks @stainlu.
- Added transient GitHub API/network retries with short backoff while preserving
  long secondary-rate-limit backoff and throttle heartbeats. Thanks @stainlu.
- Split the README dashboard into focused sections and collapsed the recent
  review table so the project page is easier to scan.

### Fixed

- Kept Codex review access read-only and verified the OpenClaw checkout before
  and after review.
- Authenticated Codex in CI without exposing GitHub write tokens to nested review
  sessions.
- Hardened strict review schema parsing and failure-evidence shape validation.
- Compacted related GitHub context for review prompts.
- Bounded shard runtime and continued after individual item review failures.
- Made review publishing reliable under concurrent workflow pushes.
- Reconciled tracked item folders when issues or PRs close or reopen.
- Hardened apply close safety with maintainer-author exclusions, protected-label
  checks, snapshot-change checks, idempotent reruns, and already-closed handling.
- Reduced apply snapshot API calls and added GitHub read/write retry backoff for
  long sweeps.
- Preserved close comment formatting and rendered applied comments from stored
  review evidence.
- Ensured README dashboard cadence metrics reflect the current review rules.
- Avoided duplicate close comments by adopting existing Codex review comments and
  adding a hidden marker for future updates.
- Corrected the GitHub Actions setup docs to describe app-token comment and
  close attribution.
- Documented the current bot/app operating model and the optional Actions write
  permission needed for app-token run cancellation.
- Cancelled stale pre-app apply run 24944438478 so it cannot keep posting
  maintainer-attributed comments.
- Guarded Codex process failure output so missing stdout/stderr does not hide the
  original review failure. Thanks @ZHOUKAILIAN.
